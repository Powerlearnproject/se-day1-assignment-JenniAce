Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software Engineering can be described as an arm of computer science that deals with design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications. (culled from Google) It plays a crucial role in the tech Industry by enabling the creation of Software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
The 1940s-1950s saw the emergence of Digital Computers which led to the development of Profane languages such as FORTRAN, C. The establishment of engineering in the 1960sled to the advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of Agile Methodologies in the 2000s. This led to the recognition of pioneers such as Grace Hopper, Alan Turning, Fred Brooks et al.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.  SDLC consists of the listed below. Each phase is essential in delivering high quality that meets the users needs, budget, time constraint and compatibility. They can be referred to as the check points in project managing software (Google - Split by Harness)

Planning - this phase defines the purpose and scope which requires strategizing for efficient execution. The team collaborates to understand the end-users needs and goals e.g. what problems can this software solve and what is its value to the user?

Requirements - this phase seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the users, eg, what are the users expecting from this software? Focus groups are created, interviews and surveys are conducted just to understand the needs and expectations of the users. This stage is important in the entire project.

Designs - this phase is all about building the framework which outlines the software functionality and aesthetic, i.e., it ensures user-friendly software that performs efficiently. In this phase we have SDD- Software Design Document. This phase ensures that the software works efficiently and provides an excellent user experience

Implementation / coding - this phase is where the engineers start converting the software designs into tangible code. This is where the engineers use programming languages such as Java to write the code which is guided by SDD and coding guidelines. This roadmap ensures that the software aligns with the vision set in the early stages. It is important to note that reviews are held at intervals to identify bugs and inconsistencies.

Testing - this s referred to as the quality inspection phase where vulnerabilities are uncovered. It aims to ensure flawless software operation before the end-users. Identified bugs are sent back to the developers for rectification. this process is a cycle or persistence until the software complies with all the parameters. 

Deployment - This is where the product which have been crafted to precision is presented to the end users. this phase requires minimal disruption for the user. such methods are referred to as the Big Bang, Blue=Green or Canary deployments. the software has to be operated with ease. it is imperative to know that this is not the end stage but a shift from project phase to product phase. 

Maintenance - this stage is characterized by constant assistance and improvement to ensure the software's best functionality and longevity that meets the customers' expectations. it tasks frequent software updates, implementing patches and fixing bugs while offering help and guidance to users facing difficulties with the software. In general, this stage considers long term strategies. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative while emphasizing on continuous feedback and adaptation. Basically, it is a change in mindset from traditional methods.  E.g. the smartphone market, from a rapidly changing market and technology with a cutting edge system to shrinking time to market products and increase innovation to simulations and automation to delivery at point of sale then finally to the need for an adaptive method in comparison to a predictive method. It thrives in a chaotic environment. There is always need for Sprints to be held for reviews and retroscope. (A guide to scrum book of knowledge Fourth Edition)

 Waterfall is sequential and rigid with phases that are completed in order. It utilizes command and control structures and is suitable for ordered and predictive environments. E.g. Construction of a building. The project starts with gathering requirements from the client followed by the design which involves blueprints and plans. Then the construction begins and the building is constructed according to the design. Waterfall is all about start to finish, follow the plan and design that has been presented from the beginning, any changes during the process can affect the entire plan and purposed timeline that has already been agreed upon.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer creates, develop and test software elements by writing codes or preparing the necessary documents for other programmers to write the code. He also maintains software using different skills and tools that ensure continual functionality.
Quality Assurance Engineer designs tests plans, scenarios, scripts or procedures. Detects errors and defects using bug tracking system and reports to the Software Developers. He also identifies, analyzes and documents problems thereby giving feedback to verify that a final product meets the company’s quality requirements. 
Project Manager is responsible for the entire team, overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. He ensures that the project objectives align with the business goals while managing resources and mitigate risks. The project meets deadlines, stay within budget and adhere to standards. Their expertise in managing timelines and resources to prevent miscommunication. (Google- www.atlassian.com)

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. 
Modern day IDEs are known to integrate popular version control systems like Git thereby making it easier for developers to manage their code while VCS allows developers to track changes to their code, collaborate with others and revert earlier versions of their code. 
An IDE normally consists of atleast a source code editor, built in automation tools and a debugger. Some such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and Lazarus contain complier and interpreter while others such as SharpDevelop and NetBeans, do not.
An example of VCS is Git and GitHub, a repository hosting service. Git is known to save historical records of every change made to the database while GitHub provides easy way to sync and share those changes

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid advance of technology
Growing customer demands
Time constraints
Software testing conflicts
Changing requirements
Limited time and resources
Security 
Engineers also struggle with complexity issues that can lead to bugs, security issues or breach and delays in development

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Quality Assurance in Software Engineering is all about eliminating bugs and guarantee that the final product meets the quality standard. Testing ensures that software operates as expected through predefined tests. (www.browserstack.com) 
Unit testing – helps to identify bugs and issues at an early stage of the development cycle. (google) 
Integration testing – is all about validation of software components, subsystems or applications working together as a system to achieve the desired functionality and performance. (www.browserstack.com)
System Testing – this is where the QA team steps in to evaluate how the various components of an application interact together within the full integrated system or application. (www.techtarget.com) 
Acceptance Testing – evaluates a product, prototype or software application to make sure it meets the specification and quality before commencing to production. Bug fixes and other modifications are carried out in a cost effective manner. (www.investopedia.com)

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a process where one structures an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative Ai model. (Wikipedia) 
Prompt Engineering ensures that AI models produce accurate and relevant outputs through the art of crafting effective prompts that guide the model’s behavior and ensuring effective human <->AI communication. Users find it easy to obtain relevant results in the first attempt. (www.datacamp.com) (https:amazon.com) 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
